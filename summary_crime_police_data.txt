Conclusion for crime activity on heat map with near by police station

- Initially we thought it would make sense for a city with high crime rate to have more police stations surrounding it 

- However, after ploting every crime incident occured in Sac county on a heat map along with near by police stations on symbol markers, we observed that they have little or no relationship.(see heatmap.png)

- To further illustrate the lack of correlation between the two factors, namely crime activity and near by police stations, we used Seaborn to apply a line regression plot and found a very weak corrlation. (see regression.png)

- Using the same two factors on a Kernal Density plot suggests that a typical city would have between 2-3 police stations regardless of the amount of crime happened in the city. (see density.png)
